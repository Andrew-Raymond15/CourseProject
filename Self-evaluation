Self-evaluation. Have you completed what you have planned? Have you got the expected outcome? If not, discuss why.


Looking back at this project I think I accompished what I had planned to an extent. At the start of the project I overestimated my skills in python so working on the project took much longer than expected. I would say I spent about 30 hours studying and learning all of the packages. The one piece I didn't finish or really have the chance to work on was the UI piece, A juypter notebook was the best I could do for the time I had. Overall for a basic sentiment analysis it works well. I'd like to expand upon it to make it smarter than just search reddit for key words.
